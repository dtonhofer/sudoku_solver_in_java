# Sudoku Solver in Java

A simple Sudoku Solver in standard Java 16.

JUnit Jupiter is used as testing framework.

This was written to test the ideas of "Constraint Solving" and how to code "Constraint Propagation" for a simple problem.

Currently the intial board is not given on the command line but is constructed through a dedicated method. Take a look at the test methods for this.

If you run `Sudoku.main()`, default initial settings will be loaded into the `Board` structure and the corresponding problem will be solved.

Take a log at `example.log` for example output.
